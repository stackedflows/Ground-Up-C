# A Brain**** Interpreter

So this is an ongoing project: first step: interpret pure brainfuck. 

First stage is now uploaded, next step is to write the vocab...

You can make a hello world program in a .txt file as followed:

![hellowworldbf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73109076/104725933-b44b2a80-572a-11eb-9fed-23d9df832e2c.png)

then the program will run and return the sequence:

    104 101 108 108 111 32 119 111 114 108 100 33,

the decimal representation of 'hello world!'

works as the wikipedia article specifies:

More complicated programs also run on this software, but i will leave it to the reader to test those out themselves.
