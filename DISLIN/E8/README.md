# e8.c

We combine all the below code

# draw.c

Given a set of points and a binary string, this algorithm draws a graph to a widget

# functions.c

Given a set of vectors, this algorithm find the group that share a minimum distance from eachother

# permutations.c

Given an array of numbers, this algorithm returns all the possible unique permutations of the array

Note that: in the so-called even coordinate system, E8 is given as the set of all vectors in R8 with length squared equal to 2 such that coordinates are either all integers or all half-integers and the sum of the coordinates is even.

This means we can hardcode a set of 8 basis vectors, and let the fun begin.
